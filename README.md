A **Food Ordering and Billing System** built in **Java**.  
This project allows customers to:

- Choose dishes from that section.  
- Enter quantity for each dish.  
- Finally, generate a **detailed bill** including:  
  - Customer details  
  - Total amount  
  - GST incurred  
  - Net amount to be paid

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is the **upgraded and more interactive version** of the project named *"Restaurant"* created during my school days.  
The **2.0 version** comes with improved functionality, better navigation, and enhanced user experience.

## ✨ Modifications in Version 2.0

### 1. Phone Number Validation  
- Validates if the phone number entered is a **valid Indian phone number** (10 digits).  
- If invalid, an appropriate message is displayed with corrective instructions.  

### 2. Improved Menu Navigation  
- Unlike the old version (where all items were shown at once), now:  
  - Items are displayed section-wise.  
  - Users can navigate between sections.  

### 3. Better User Interface  
- Bill and item selection are displayed in a **clear, organized, and user-friendly way**, even though it runs in the terminal.  

### 4. Edge Case Handling  
- In the older version, a **wrong entry terminated the program** and printed the bill.  
- Now, such cases are **handled gracefully**:  
  - An error message is shown.  
  - The user is prompted for further action instead of abrupt termination.
