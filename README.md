# Food Ordering and Billing System 2.0
This project is about the food ordering and billing system of a resturant. This project allows the customer to first select the section to order and then select the dish from that section. In order to select a particular dish, the user(customer) needs to press the number before the dish and enter the quantity. After selecting the dishes, the customer gets a bill including the details of customer, the total amount, the GST incured and the net amount to be paid.

This project is the upgraded and more interactive version of the project named "Restaurant" during my school days. There are some features int this 2.0 version which has been modified.

  ## The modifications include:
  ### 1. Validation of the phone number: 
  Whenever the phone number is input by the customer, the program control validates the the phone number for an Indian phone number. It checks for the presence of the 10 digits in
     the phone number. If the phone number contains less digits then, a message is displayed and the user is supposed to do as per the instruction given on the screen.
   ### 2. Better navigation throughout the menu: 
  This version has a more efficient and user friendly navigation throughout the menu. In the previous version, all of the items were displayed at a time and the option of returning to the main menu was no possible  but in this version there is an option to change the section also.
   ### 3. Better UI: 
   Though the bill is getting displayedon the terminal, yet the UI of the bill and the item selection has been kept accodring to the convenience of the user.
  ### 4. Handling of the edge cases: 
  In the previous version, the control flow used to get terminated and bill used to get printed when a wrong entry was done. In this version, the such cases has been handled. The control flow does not gets terminated upon such input, instead a message is displayed and furhter actions are asked to be done.
