# Food Ordering and Billing System 2.0
This project is about the food ordering and billing system of a resturant. This billing system allows the customer to first select the dishes to be ordered. 
After selecting the dishes, the customer gets a bill including the details of customer, the total amount, the GST incured and the net amount to be paid.

This project is the upgraded and more interactive version of the project named "Restaurant" during my school days. There are some features int this 2.0 version which has been modified.
The link of the previous version: 

  # The modifications include:
  1. Validation of the phone number: Whenever the phone number is input by the customer, the program control validates the the phone number for an Indian phone number. It checks for the presence of the 10 digits in
     the phone number. If the phone number contains less digits then, a message is displayed and the user is supposed to do as per the instruction given on the screen.
  2. Better navigation between sections: This version has a more efficient and user friendly navigation throughout the menu.
  3. Better UI: Though the bill is getting displayedon the terminal, yet the UI of the bill and the item selection has been kept accoring to the convenience of the user.
